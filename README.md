### Why Cucerbits?

DevOps needs a lightweight framework that will allow for executable specification of 'Product Hypothesis'. You can add Cucerbits to your toolchain and achieve complete automation from 'Idea' to 'Implementation'.

Cucerbits will aid copmmunication between Product Development and other contributors involved in the product delivery lifecycle. 

Cucerbits operates on a 'Belief System' and uses Gherkin like systnax to describe 'Beliefs' that are then stored in a '.belief' file. Within a belief file we describe the basis for those beliefs and methods to test our beliefs. When we test the basis of our beliefs we will either recieve 'Confirmation' of our beliefs when those tests pass. When we test the basis of our beliefs and we are proven comprehensively wrong we will receive a revelation. It works like this.
