### Why Cucerbits?

DevOps needs a lightweight framework that will allow for executable specification of product hypothesis. You can add Cucerbits to your toolchain and achieve complete automation from 'Idea' to 'Done'.

Cucerbits will aid copmmunication between Product Development and other contributors involved in the product delivery lifecycle. 

Cucerbits operates on a belief system and uses Gherkin like systnax to describe those beliefs that are stored in a '.belief' file. Within a belief file we describe the basis for those beliefs and methods to test our beliefs. When are beleifs are proved comprehensively wrong we may discvoer a revelation. It works like this.

Belief : 
  Test : 
    Comfirmation : 
    Revelation :
